This is my website.
I have added some of my projects in this website too.
1. Weather App:
   It is a weather application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with real-time weather information. I have integrated a third-party weather API to fetch and display accurate weather data.
   Technologies Used:
      - HTML
      - CSS
      - JavaScript
      - open weather api
2. Tic-Tac-Toe:
   I have earlier built a tic-Tac-toe game in C++ which was designed to play against the computer. But, this tic-tac-toe here is designed utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the two-person gameplay.

3. Websites:
   Also, I have added some other basic websites that I have built in the past.
